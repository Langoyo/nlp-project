#         is repetitive, but we've kept it for clarity.

# later.

# in a batch. We're moving from a Python array of tuples, to a padded 2D tensor.

# Completely optional aside on preprocessing in __init__.

# In this case, you'd loop over your dataset in __init__, passing data 
# to __getitem__ and storing it in another instance variable. Then,
# you can simply return the preprocessed data in __getitem__ instead of
# doing the preprocessing.
# 
# There is a tradeoff though: can you think of one?
